## Plugins

This repository keeps plugin metadata in [`plugins/registry.json`](./plugins/registry.json).
Each plugin lives in its own directory under `plugins/` and should include a
README describing configuration and setup.

### antigravity-auth

The `antigravity-auth` plugin is staged under `plugins/antigravity-auth`. The
upstream source lives in `yetone/alma-plugins/plugins/antigravity-auth`. Use
`./scripts/import-antigravity-auth.sh` to import the upstream files when you
have GitHub access.
